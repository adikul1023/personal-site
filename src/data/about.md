# Intro

I am a student at VIT Bhopal University, currently pursuing a BTech in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. My academic journey is driven by a deep passion for technology and security, with the ultimate goal of becoming an expert in the field of cybersecurity. I enjoy working on web development projects, exploring new technologies, and understanding how web applications function. This interest complements my role as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at the [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com), where I oversee technical projects and manage development efforts.

In my spare time, I like to invest my energy in learning new things, particularly in the field of cybersecurity, to stay ahead of emerging trends and threats. I also enjoy developing my chess skills, as the game enhances my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities—qualities that are essential in both cybersecurity and life.

# Some History

- At age 5, I attended a Scholastic book fair and picked up my very first book about planets. This was the beginning of a lifelong interest in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy). Every year, I would return to these book fairs and expand my collection, diving deeper into the mysteries of space and the universe.

- At 14, I took the [National Space Olympiad](https://www.edukidsworld.com/space-olympiad.html) on a whim, without studying. Despite that, I managed to score fairly well, which further encouraged my growing fascination with astronomy and space science.

- When I was 16, the [COVID-19 lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns) pushed everything online, and this shift ignited a new passion for technology. As I spent more time exploring the digital world, my curiosity naturally gravitated toward [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity)—a field that intrigued me for its blend of problem-solving and technical challenges.

- Later that year, I almost got into trouble when I attempted to modify my score in a mock exam at my coaching institute. It was a risky move that taught me valuable lessons about responsibility and the ethical use of technology.

- At 17, I connected with a senior who had co-founded an ed-tech startup called [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com). This marked a turning point, as I volunteered to develop their website, an opportunity that sparked my interest in [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) and gave me my first taste of leadership in a technical role.

- By 18, I had enrolled in [VIT Bhopal University](https://vitbhopal.ac.in) to pursue a [BTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) in Cybersecurity and [Digital Forensics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics). Around the same time, I officially became the [CTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer) of [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com), a role that allowed me to hone my technical and leadership skills while driving the company's technology strategy.

- At 19, I achieved a significant milestone by earning my [CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) certification, which further validated my expertise in cybersecurity and set the stage for my continued growth in the field.
