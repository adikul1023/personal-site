I'm Adi Kulkarni, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at VIT Bhopal University. I am CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) certified by EC-Council and also hold the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) credential from ISC2. I'm passionate about all things infosec, and my learning journey spans from red teaming to AI-driven security.

I served as the CTO of [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com), where I helped build an educational space-tech initiative to inspire the next generation. My projects reflect a commitment to practical cybersecurity:

- [WebScan](https://github.com/adikul1023/webscan): A simple website vulnerability scanner.
- [HoneyCrypt](https://github.com/adikul1023/HoneyCrypt): A multidecoy AES-based encryption tool to confuse attackers.
- [SecureVibe](https://github.com/adikul1023/SecureVibe): A VS Code extension that detects insecure coding patterns.
- [FaceGuard](https://github.com/adikul1023/face-verification): A face verification system using standard non-IR cameras for secure biometric authentication.
- [ZeroCall](https://github.com/Secure-Calling-EPICS/Secure-Web-Calling): A Zero Trust secure web calling platform (under development).
- I've also worked on a research paper focused on electric vehicle (EV) security.

In my free time, I enjoy learning, contributing to open-source, and participating in CTFs. If you're into security, AI, or solving hard problems, let's connect.

# Some History

- When I was a kid, my parents gifted me a book about space. That single book turned into a universe of curiosity. I was soon reading about black holes, time dilation, spacecraft, and building paper models of rockets. That passion for the unknown — for exploration — has never left me.
- In 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown, I stumbled upon a YouTube video about ethical hacking. I watched one video, then another, then another. Before I knew it, I was deep into the world of firewalls, exploits, payloads, and CTFs. My learning became consistent, and that’s when I realized: this is more than curiosity — this is my path.
- In 2021, I earned my [CEH](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) certification.
- In 2023, I added the [ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CC) to my name.
- In 2024, I became the CTO of Astronautic Institute and began contributing to tech-for-good initiatives while continuing my cybersecurity work.
- In 2025, I completed TryHackMe's Junior Penetration Tester and CompTIA PenTest+ paths, and I'm currently working through the Red Teaming path. My team "Predators" placed 34th in the Asia-Oceania region at the Kaspersky SAS CTF 2025.

# I Like

- Cybersecurity — red teaming, blue teaming, threat modeling
- Space — it still excites me as much as it did when I was a kid
- Chess — my addiction, my peace, my strategy school. I’ve played in several tournaments and continue learning every day.
- Minimalism — in design and in life
- Long walks with lo-fi music and thoughts too big to speak
- Building tools that are both useful and elegant

# Fun Facts

- I built my first website at 17 and realized I loved breaking things more than building them — hence the switch to cybersecurity.
- I never formally studied chess, but I kept losing until I didn't — and now I'm addicted.
- My room is usually a mess, but my VS Code is pristine.

# I Dream Of

- Building my own Linux-based OS focused on privacy and persistence — part Tails, part Qubes.
- Contributing to cutting-edge cybersecurity research that actually makes a difference.
- Working with companies or people who care about ethics, security, and impact.
- Helping people protect their digital lives — without needing to become tech experts.
