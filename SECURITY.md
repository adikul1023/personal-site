## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this website seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please do not discuss it in the public issue tracker.

### Private Reporting (Recommended)

Please use the **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](../../security/advisories/new)** feature on this repository. This allows you to report the issue privately without exposing the vulnerability to the public.

1. Click the **Security** tab in this repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.

I try to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.

### What to expect

* I will investigate the issue.
* I will let you know when the issue has been patched.
* I will not disclose the issue publicly until it is resolved.
